<h1>DELETE account</h1>

<p>Remove a specific user account.</p>


<br/><hr/>
<h2>HTTP Request: Headers</h2>

<p>The request method is DELETE.<br/>
For example:</p>

<pre>
DELETE /account/alexander.j.ryan@gmail.com HTTP/1.1
Host: dev5:8888
Authorization: Basic YWxleGFuZGVyLmoucnlhbkBnbWFpbC5jb206YmVhc3Q=
</pre>

<p>This service may only be used by registered users who are authorized to use it.<br/>
The HTTP Basic Authentication scheme is used to pass the encoded username:password of the user.</p>

<p>More so, the user is only allowed to delete the account that he owns.<br/>
Note, after the account has been deleted, service invocations that require authentication
will not longer work.</p>

<br/><hr/>
<h2>HTTP Request: Headers: Request Method Parameters</h2>

<p>By convention, when the method is <b>GET</b> or <b>DELETE</b>, 
data is passed to a service is via the parameters of the request method 
in the "headers" section of the HTTP request.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>
NOTE: Only one account is allowed per email address, 
so the "email" field uniquely specifies the account to delete.<br/><br/>

NOTE: The user who is deleting this account must be the owner of the account.<br/>
</p>

<pre>
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Basic YWxleGFuZGVyLmoucnlhbkBnbWFpbC5jb206YmVhc3Q=
DELETE /account
</pre>

<h3>Description</h3>

<table width="100%" border="1">
<tr>
<td><span style="color:red">email</span><br/>(required)</td>
<td>
The email address used to uniquely identify the account that we wish to delete.
</tr>
</table>

<br/><hr/>
<h2>HTTP Response: HEAD: Headers</h2>

<p>The following response codes are possible from this service.<br/>
(Client code must handle each of them.):</p>

<ul>
<li><b>200 Success</b></li>
<li><b>400 Bad Request</b></li>
<li><b>500 Server Error</b></li>
</ul>

<p>
The content of the body of the HTTP Response will always be JSON.<br/>
Therefore, the following header will always be sent:<br/>
<b>Content-Type: application/json</b>
</p>


<br/><hr/>
<h2>HTTP Response: Body</h2>

<p>The body of the response should always contain JSON.<br/>
The type of JSON returned varies by the response code.<br/>
4 types of JSON are possible.</p>


<h3>(1) Response Code = 200: &quot;Success&quot; </h3>
<p>If the service executed successfully<br/>
JSON like the following will be returned in the body of the response:</p>

<pre>
HTTP/1.1 200 Success
</pre>

<p>NOTE: If the response code of 200 was returned, the account was deleted.<br/>
 No data is returned in the body of the HTTP response.</p>


<h3>(3) Response Code = 400: &quot;Bad Request&quot; </h3>
<p>If there was a major error the request that prevents us from even processing it,<br/>
the standard JSON describing the error will be returned in the body of the response:</p>

<pre>
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request

{
    "errorCode": 1,
    "errorMessage": "INVALID JSON",
    "data": "No JSON was POSTed!"
}
</pre>

<h3>(4) Response Code = 500: &quot;Server Error&quot; </h3>
<p>If there was a major error the request that prevents us from even processing it,<br/>
the standard JSON describing the error will be returned in the body of the response:</p>

<pre>
HTTP/1.1 500 Server Error

{
    "errorCode": 3,
    "errorMessage": "SERVER ERROR",

}
</pre>
