<h1>POST deviceAccount</h1>

<p>Create a <a href="../2_common_behaviors.html#deviceAccounts">device account</a>.</p>

<br/><hr/>
<h2>HTTP Request: Headers</h2>

<p>The request method is POST.<br/>
For example:</p>

<pre>
POST /deviceAccount HTTP/1.1
Host: test.alpineconnectivity.com:8888
</pre>


<br/><hr/>
<h2>HTTP Request: BODY: Parameters</h2>

<p>When the HTTP method is POST or PUT, the RESTful convention is 
to pass data to a service is via the body of the HTTP request.<br/>
This service passes data in this fashion in a JSON data structure.<br/>
An example of the data structure and a detailed description of its elements follows...</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<pre>
POST /deviceAccount HTTP/1.1
Host: test.alpineconnectivity.com:8888

{
    "deviceId": "68753A44-4D6F-1226-9C60-0050E4C00067",
    "password": "Z5y334yaksnefovuI83TT"
}
</pre>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data in the JSON ...</p>

<table width="100%" border="1">


<tr>
<td><span style="color:red">deviceId</span><br/>(required)</td>
<td>
An ID that is unique to the device that sent the request.<br/>
iPhone device IDs look different than Android device IDs.<br/>
In theory the device ID is tied to the hardware of the device and thus will never change.<br/>
In practice the device ID is highly unlikely to change.<br/>
The device ID sent is guaranteed to be unique across all Alpine applications used 
on that device. Even if all the applications are un-installed and reinstalled,
the device ID will not change.<br/>
The only thing that might change the device ID is a complete wiping of the
operating system.
</tr>

<tr>
<td><span style="color:red">password</span><br/>(required)</td>
<td>
A password that is unique to the device.<br/>
This password will probably be randomly generated since the whole purpose of the
device account is to give user account-like capabilities without requiring them
to select a username + password.<br/>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>androidRegistrationId<br/>(optional)</td>
<td>optionally, an android registration id may be specified.<br/>
This number may be used to send the user messages 
on their android device via Google Cloud Messaging.</td>
</tr>

</table>

<h2>HTTP Response: HEAD: Headers</h2>

<p>The following response codes are possible from this service.<br/>
(Client code must handle each of them.):</p>

<ul>
<li><b>201 Created</b></li>
<li><b>400 Bad Request</b></li>
<li><b>500 Server Error</b></li>
</ul>

<p>
The content of the body of the HTTP Response will always be JSON.<br/>
Therefore, the following header will always be sent:<br/>
<b>Content-Type: application/json</b>
</p>


<br/><hr/>
<h2>HTTP Response: Body</h2>

<p>If data is returned in the body of the response,
it should always come in the form of JSON.<br/>
The type of JSON returned varies by the response code.<br/>
4 types of JSON are possible.</p>


<h3>(1) Response Code = 201: &quot;Created&quot; </h3>
<p>If the service executed successfully<br/>
JSON like the following will be returned in the body of the response:</p>

<pre>
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
</pre>

<p>NOTE: If the response code of 201 was returned, the device account was created.<br/>
 No data is returned in the body of the HTTP response.</p>


<h3>(3) Response Code = 400: &quot;Bad Request&quot; </h3>
<p>If there was a major error the request that prevents us from even processing it,<br/>
the standard JSON describing the error will be returned in the body of the response:</p>

<pre>
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request

{
    "errorCode": 1,
    "errorMessage": "INVALID JSON",
    "data": "No JSON was POSTed!"
}
</pre>


<h3>(4) Response Code = 500: &quot;Server Error&quot; </h3>
<p>If there was a major error the request that prevents us from even processing it,<br/>
the standard JSON describing the error will be returned in the body of the response:</p>

<pre>
HTTP/1.1 500 Server Error

{
    "errorCode": 3,
    "errorMessage": "SERVER ERROR",
    "data": "Error inserting record into the database.."
}
</pre>
