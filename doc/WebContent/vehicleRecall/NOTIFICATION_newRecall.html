<h1>NOTIFICATION: New Recall</h1>

<p>A new recall has been issued for your vehicle.</p>

<br/><hr/>
<h2>Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) Message Format</h2>


<pre>
{
    "recordId": 123456789,
    "make": "FORD",
    "model": "MUSTANG",
    "year": "2007"
}
</pre>


<br/>
The user is receiving this notification because he/she selected to register
one or more vehicles by calling the <a href="POST_vehicles.html">POST vehicles</a> service.
<br/><br/>

In order to stop receiving these messages, the user must change the list of 
vehicles associated with his/her account by calling the <a href="DELETE_vehicles.html">DELETE vehicles</a> service.
<br/><br/>

The notification gets sent to the user when an administrator invokes the 
<a href="POST_recalls.html">POST recalls</a> service and a <b>MATCH</b>
is discovered between the vehicle the user registered and a vehicle listed in one of the
recalls posted.
<br/><br/>

When the user receives this notification, the app developer will typically want 
to retrieve the details of the new recall by invoking the <a href="GET_recall.html">GET recall</a> service.
The recordId received in the GCM notification is the one that should be used 
to call the <a href="GET_recall.html">GET recall</a> service.
<br/><br/>

The reason that the make, model & year is delivered in addition to the recordId
is that the user *might* select to register more than a single vehicle. It therefore
might be useful to the app developer to know which of these multiple vehicles
the new recall has been issued for.
