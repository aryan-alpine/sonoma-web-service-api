<h1>POST recalls</h1>

<p>ADMIN ONLY. Add new recall a list of one or more recalls. <br/>
For each individual recall - for a specific vehicle (make, model, year) - <br/>
send a GCM notification to everyone affected.
</p>

<br/><hr/>
<h2>HTTP Request: Headers</h2>

<p>The request method is POST.<br/>
For example:</p>

<pre>
POST /vehicleRecall/recalls HTTP/1.1
Host: test.alpineconnectivity.com:8888
</pre>

<!--  
<br/><hr/>
<h2>HTTP Request: Headers: Request Method Parameters</h2>

<p>One way to pass data to a service is via the parameters of the request method 
in the "headers" section of the HTTP request.<br/>
This approach is customary when the HTTP method is GET or DELETE.<br/>
The HTTP method of this service is POST.<br/>
This service does not utilize this approach.</p>
-->

<br/><hr/>
<h2>HTTP Request: BODY: Parameters</h2>

<p>When the HTTP method is POST or PUT, 
the conventional way to pass data to a service is via the body of the HTTP request.<br/>
This service passes data in this fashion in a JSON data structure.<br/>
An example of the data structure and a detailed description of its elements follows...</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<pre>

<li><b>400 Bad Request</b></li>
<li><b>401 Not Authorized</b></li>
<li><b>500 Server Error</b></li>

Therefore, the following header will always be sent:<br/>
<b>Content-Type: application/json</b>
</p>


<br/><hr/>
<h2>HTTP Response: Body</h2>

<p>The body of the response should always contain JSON.<br/>
The type of JSON returned varies by the response code.<br/>

<p>If there was a major error in the request that prevents us from even processing it,<br/>
the standard JSON describing the error will be returned in the body of the response:</p>

<pre>
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request

{
    "errorCode": 1,
    "errorMessage": "INVALID JSON",
    "data": "No JSON was POSTed!"
}
</pre>


<h3>(3) Response Code = 401: &quot;Not Authorized&quot; </h3>
