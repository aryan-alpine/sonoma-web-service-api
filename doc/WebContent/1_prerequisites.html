<h1>Alpine REST API</h1>

<br/>

<br/><hr/>
<h1>Pre-requisites</h1>

<p>In order to understand this documentation, you must have a solid understanding of:</p>
<a href="#http">(1) HTTP: Hypertext Transport Protocol</a><br/>
<a href="#rest">(2) REST: Representational State Transfer</a><br/>
<a href="#http">(3) JSON: JavaScript Object Notation</a><br/>

<br/><hr/>
<a name="http"></a>
<h2>(1) HTTP: Hypertext Transport Protocol</h2>

<p>You must know, for example:</p>

<p>HTTP requests and responses are both documents that are structured into 2 parts:<br/>
(1) HTTP Headers<br/>
(2) HTTP Body</p>

<h3>(1) <b>HTTP Headers</b>:<br/></h3>

A collection of name/value pairs specified by the HTTP specification.<br/>


<h4>Request Headers</h4>
You should be familiar with the most common types of HTTP Headers used in HTTP requests ...<br/>
The most important of the request headers is <b>the request method</b><br/>

<h5>Request method (mandatory)</h5>
Example request methods include:  <b>POST, GET, PUT & DELETE</b><br/>
(Note: In REST these methods correspond to <b>CREATE, READ, UPDATE & DELETE: CRUD</b>)

<h4>Response Headers</h4>
You should be familiar with the most common types of HTTP Headers used in HTTP responses ...<br/>
The most important of the response headers is <b>the response code</b><br/>

<h5>Response Codes (mandatory)</h5>
The first line of the HTTP Response will always contain a response code.<br/>


Example response codes indicating success:<br/>
<b>HTTP/1.0 200 OK</b><br/>
<b>HTTP/1.0 201 Created</b><br/>
<br/>
Example response codes indicating failure:<br/>
<b>HTTP/1.0 400 Bad Request</b><br/>
<b>HTTP/1.0 500 Server Error</b><br/><br/>

Here is a list of all possible HTTP response codes:<br/>
<a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml">HTTP Status Code Registry</a><br/><br/>
<br/>

If the service just "GETs" data, the response code to indicate success will usually be <b>200: OK</b><br/>
If the service just "POSTs" or "PUTs" data, the response code to indicate success will usually be <b>201: Created</b>.<br/>
3XX response codes usually indicate that a networking error of some sort.<br/>
4XX response codes usually indicate that an error the occurred because YOU did something wrong.<br/>
5XX response codes usually indicate that an error that occurred because something broke on the server.<br/>
<br/>
Client code should be able to handle any response code delivered by the server.<br/>
<br/>
For each service in this specification, the list of possible response codes returned by the service
is specified. Client code should be prepared to handle all of these gracefully.<br/>
In addition, other response code can be returned by proxy servers, web servers, etc.<br/>
Client code should be able to handle these as well.<br/>




<h3>(2) <b>HTTP Body</b>:<br/></h3>
May contain one of a variety of types of content or none at all.<br/>
The type of content contained in the body should be specified by the <b>Content-Type</b> header.<br/>

<br/>
The most common Content-Types used in Alpine Restful Services include:<br/>
<b>Content-Type: application/json</b><br/>
<b>Content-Type: image/jpeg</b><br/>
Con<b>tent-Type: image/png</b><br/><br/>

A full listing of all possible Content-Types can be found here:<br/>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME_type">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME_type</a><br/><br/>
<br/>For example:<br/>
JSON formatted request or response data<br/>
Image data<br/>
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.





This represents a minimum of what you need to know about HTTP.<br/>
More in-depth knowledge is recommended.<br/>
If you don't know the answers to these questions, you need to study.<br/><br/>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol</a>
<br/><a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt">RFC2616: Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1</a>

<h2>(2) REST: Representational State Transfer</h2>

If you don't know what REST is, you need to study.<br/><br/>

<br/>

<br/><hr/>
<a name="json"></a>
<h2>(3) JSON: JavaScript Object Notation</h2>

The HTTP BODY of both the HTTP Requests and Responses of most Alpine services 
consists of JSON formated data.<br/>
If you don't know what JSON is, you need to study.<br/><br/>
