    <td>Yes</td>
    <td><em>Return full description for all updated songs.</em><br/>
    The return JSON now contains a full description of everything we know about the song
    on the server.<br/>
    This includes all of the details about the users individual preferences about the sang
    AND all the details about the master record of the song.<br/>
    Probably of most importance to developer are the (potentially recalculated) energy field,
    and the potentially altered fields of topGenre, subGenre and tempo.<br/>

    <td><em>2 likability data field changes in the JSON.</em><br/>
    (1) <b>isFavorite</b> changed to <b>isSonomaFavorite</b>.<br/>
    There is no favoriting done in iTunes, so this will not be used in "POST songLibrary".<br/>
    (2) changed <b>bookMarkedTime</b> to <b>sonomaFavoriteDate</b><br/>
    This is the epoch time that the user favorited the song in sonoma.<br/>

    <td>Yes</td>
    <td><em>multiple likability field changes.</em><br/>
    (1) added <b>addDate</b> to mark epoch time that a song was added to the library.<br/>
    (2) changed <b>appearsInPlayList</b> (a boolean value)<br/>
    to <b>playListCount</b> to identify the number of play lists the song is a part of.<br/>
    Assumption: Songs that are included in more playlists are more liked by the user.<br/>
    (3) added <b>isMusic</b> boolean field.<br/>
    There is a need to filter out audio books, spoken word and other non-music audio files from 
    the audio files which contain music.

    <td><a href="sonoma/POST_songLibrary2.html">POST/PUT/GET songLibrary</a></td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td><em>multiple genre field changes.</em><br/>
    (1) Differentiation between <b>topGenre</b> and <b>subGenre</b>.<br/>
    Our energy calculation algorithms require us to differentiate between these 2 different
    types of iTunes genres. Our goal should be to ascertain the subGenre. However, if in lieu
    of this, identifying the top level genre is better than not identifying any genre at all.<br/>
    (2) Client-side genre processing:<br/>
    In the request, we used to send just a single genre field called "iTunesGenre".<br/>
    This contains whatever genre information that the user currently has in their iTunes record for that song.<br/>
    Now, it is anticipated that the client may execute a local algorithm to change this value.<br/>
    Fields are now provided for both of these data items.<br/>
    <i>Summary of changes</i>
    3 fields will be sent: <b>clientRawGenre</b>, <b>clientTopGenre</b> and <b>clientSubGenre</b><br/>
    The first is the raw unprocessed genre that exists before processing.<br/>
    The second is the genre that has been processed by the client.<br/>
    Currently we expect that this "processing" is a simple check against a list of recognized genres.<br/>
    In the future, more sophisticated client-side genre mapping algorithms may be used.<br/>
    There is also a change in the data returned by the server.<br/>
    For each song, we will return 5 fields:<br/>
    <b>clientRawGenre</b>, <b>serverTopGenre</b> and <b>serverSubGenre</b>, <br/>
    Example:<br/>
                "clientRawGenre": "Hip Hop",<br/>
                "clientTopGenre": "",<br/>
                "clientSubGenre": ""<br/>
                "serverTopGenre": "Hip-Hop/Rap", <br/>               
                "serverSubGenre": "Gangsta Rap",<br/>
    In addition to this, response JSON also contains a link to the master record
    for each song. This master record used to contain a simple <b>genre</b> field.<br/>
    The master record will now contain the following 2 fields:<br/>
    <b>topGenre</b> and <b>subGenre</b>.

  <tr>
    <td>2014-05-30</td>
    <td><a href="sonoma/PUT_songLibrary.html">PUT songLibrary</a></td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td><em>Share new tempo info with other users.</em><br/>If the tempo is updated, we attempt to offer value to other users by sharing this information with them.<br/>
    We update both the <b>tempo</b> and the <b>energy</b> fields in the master record of the song.<br/>
    New users will automatically get this information as soon as they add the same song to their library.<br/>
    Existing users who already have this song in their library will not be updated.<br/>
    It is assumed that they will calculate the tempo information themselves very quickly.<br/>
    However, AFTER calculating the tempo for the songs they don't have that information for
    and sending this information to the sever via this service, they SHOULD request updated
    energy numbers for those songs, because these very likely will have changed.</td>

    <td><a href="sonoma/PUT_songLibrary.html">PUT songLibrary</a></td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td><em>Retrieve new energy numbers for songs whose tempo has changed.</em><br/>
    The JSON returned along with a 201 status code has changed.<br/>
    Before, nothing was returned.<br/>
    Now, if the PUT request specified new tempo info for the song, the response will contain
    the newly calculated energy for the song. It will also contain some of the variables used
    to calculate it.</td>

    <td><a href="sonoma/POST_songLibrary.html">POST songLibrary</a></td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td><em>Now returns energy level for every song added.</em><br/>
    We now return a (1) genre [try], (2) tempo [try] and (3) energy [guaranteed] for every song uploaded.<br/>
    The return JSON has changed to reflect this.</td>

    <tr>

    <td><a href="sonoma/POST_songLibrary.html">POST songLibrary</a></td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td><em>removed the <b>userId</b> input parameter from the JSON</em><br/>
    Now checks to ensure that the account being used to create a library actually exists.<br/>
    Previously users could subvert this check by authentication with one user in the "Authorization" header
    and then creating the songLibrary for another user.<br/>
    The bug has been fixed by eliminating the practice of sending up 2 different userId parameters.<br/>
    We now use the userId in the Authorization header only.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>

    <td><a href="sonoma/POST_songLibrary.html">POST songLibrary</a></td>
    <td>No</td>    
    <td><em>Restricted the number of songs uploaded to 100 per request.</em><br/>
    This upper bound is needed to ensure that processing can be completed quickly enough
    to return a timely response to the client.<br/>
    As processing speeds are improved, this limit may be increased.</td>

    This has been done though all of the methods of the songLibrary resource to alleviate confusion.</td>
