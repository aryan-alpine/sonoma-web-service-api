<h1>Common Behaviors</h1>

<p>You can expect the following behavior from all of Alpine web-services:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#returnCodes">Return Codes</a></li>

<li><a href="#deviceAccounts">Device Accounts</a></li>
<li><a href="#caching">Caching</a></li>
</ul>



<a name="returnCodes"></a>
<br/><hr/>
<h2>(1) Return Codes</h2>

We follow the convention of relying on the return codes of the HTTP protocol
to indicate the return status of all of our services.<br/>
However, we only use a small subset of these return codes.<br/>
The service description for each individual service describes exactly what
return codes you (as a client developer) need to be able to handle
for that particular service.<br/>
Here is the list of all possible return codes 
and a description of when you can expect to receive them.

<br/><br/>

<table width="100%" border="1">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>HTTP status code</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>200</td>
  <td>Success</td>
  <td>If the service is GET, PUT or DELETE, a return code of 200 will be returned
  to let you know that the service executed correctly. <br/>
  You should *always* check the return code of the service before attempting
  to process the return data. If the return code is not the one you expect,
  the data you are attempting to process will be different than you expect
  and your code will break.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>201</td>
  <td>Created</td>
  <td>If the service is a POST, it is usually "creating" new data on the server,
  so we will return a success code of 201 instead of the usual 200 code
  to let you know that a record was successfully created.<br/>
  The body of the HTTP Response will usually contain an identifier that you 
  can and should use to access the resource that you just created on the server.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>400</td>
  <td>Bad Request</td>
  <td>There was something wrong with the data that was sent to the server.<br/>
  It might be data that was sent as JSON in the HTTP Body of an HTTP POST or PUT.<br/>
  It might be data that was sent as parameters to an HTTP GET or DELETE method.<br/>
  Or it might be data that was sent via another HTTP Header.<br/>
  When you receive this error, look in the JSON returned for a description of exactly 
  what the problem was.<br/>
  Review the validation rules for the data specified in the service description
  for the particular service you are using
  and alter the data that you are sending accordingly.<br/>
  It is expected that these kinds of problems will be worked out in development
  and should not occur very frequently in production.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>401</td>
  <td>Not Authorized</td>
  <td>Some services require that the user be authenticated in order to use them.<br/>
  For these services, a valid username/password must be sent in the HTTP "Authorization" header
  using the standard HTTP Basic Authentication mechanism.<br/>
  If it is not, the 401 error code will be returned to you.<br/>
  At which point, you should prompt your use to either enter the correct credentials,
  or create an account if they would like to use this service.<br/>
  See the section on <a href="#security">Security</a> below for more information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>500</td>
  <td>Server Error</td>
  <td>Something went wrong on the server.<br/>
  A description of what went wrong will be contained in the body of the respose.<br/>
  There's not much that you can do about this other than ensure that 
  your app handles the error code gracefully
  by providing a pleasant experience for the user.<br/>
  Rest assured that *every* time any error occurs on the server
  an email is automatically sent to an administrator describing exactly what happened
  and providing them with all the information they need in order to fix the problem fast.</td>

<a name="security"></a>
<br/><hr/>
<h2>(2) Security</h2>

We use the standard HTTP Basic Authentication mechanism to authenticate users of services.<br/>

<h3>Client side</h3>
When the user agent wants to send the server authentication credentials it may use the <b>Authorization</b> header.<br/>
The Authorization header is constructed as follows:<br/>
Username and password are combined into a string "username:password"<br/>
The resulting string literal is then encoded using Base64<br/>
The authorization method and a space i.e. "Basic " is then put before the encoded string.<br/><br/>
For example, if the user agent uses 'Aladdin' as the username and 'open sesame' as the password then the header is formed as follows:<br/>
Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==

<br/><br/>
Here is an example of what a full HTTP request looks like containing the authorization header.<br/>

<pre>
POST /sonoma/event HTTP/1.1
Host: dev5:8888
Authorization: Basic YWxleGFuZGVyLmoucnlhbkBnbWFpbC5jb206YmVhc3Q=

{
    "type": "listen",
    "song": {
        "artist": "Metallica",
        "title": "Fade to Black"
    },
    "eq": {
        "id": "51f973830d861c2c5c626910",
        "name": "Metallica Settings"
    }
}
</pre>


<h3>Server side</h3>

The server decodes and checks the authentication credentials before deciding how to respond to the request.<br/>
If valid credentials are found, the server allows the request to be processed.<br/>
If valid credentials are not found, the server responds with a <b>401 Not Authorized</b> response code.<br/>
According to the standard, the server must also specify exactly what "realm" they'd like you to authenticate against
by returning the <b>WWW-Authenticate</b> header as well.

<br/><br/>
For our purposes, we are using single-sign on for all alpine services, so the realm will always be the same.<br/>
That means you can ignore the <b>WWW-Authenticate</b> header.<br/>
Always, however, code to handle a 401 response code for a service that requires authentication.<br/>
You can, for example, give the user the option to reset their password.<br/>
Ideally, if they don't already have an alpine account, you would prompt them to create an account or enter existing credentials *before* sending the request to the server.<br/>
In practice, if the client-side code is robust, the only time you should see this 401 error code 
is when the user has changed their password on another device but the device they are currently using has stored the old password.

<br/><br/>
Here is an example of what an HTTP response might look like when there was something wrong
the authentication credentials sent in the request to use the service:<br/>


<pre>
HTTP/1.1 401 Not Authorized
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="alpineconnectivity.com"

{
    "errorCode": 401,
    "errorMessage": "Not Authorized",
    "data": "Authorization header was not found."
}
</pre>


<a name="deviceAccounts"></a>
<br/><hr/>
<h2>(3) Device Accounts</h2>

The general policy that we follow is to allow read-only services that do not expose
sensitive data to be used without any form of authentication.<br/>
On the other hand, services that write data, in particular data that belongs to a particular user,
usually require authentication in order to use.<br/>
However, some applications allow users to write account specific information to a server-side
data store without requiring the user to create a user account.<br/>
The reason for this is to offer more value (in the form of personalized services) 
to the user BEFORE asking them to make the investment of creating an actual
user account.<br/>
In so doing the goal is to reduce the number of users who leave when they are asked 
to create an account.<br/>
The way this is accomplished is by sending up a deviceId + (randomly generated) password
in the Authorization header instead of the traditional username + password.<br/>
On the server-side, all user data will be associated with the device id.

<pre>
POST /sonoma/event HTTP/1.1
Host: dev5:8888
Authorization: Basic Njg3NTNBNDQtNEQ2Ri0xMjI2LTlDNjAtMDA1MEU0QzAwMDY3OnJhbmRvbVBhc3N3b3JkMTIz

{
    "type": "listen",
    "song": {
        "artist": "Metallica",
        "title": "Fade to Black"
    },
    "eq": {
        "id": "51f973830d861c2c5c626910",
        "name": "Metallica Settings"
    }
}
</pre>

Notice that it looks very similar to the previous "Basic Authentication" example.
<br/>What's different is the actual content of the base64 encoded string
<br/>Instead of "username:password" the string is now "deviceId:password"
<br/><br/>



Some services require only a device id, whereas others will require an
actual user account.<br/>
When the user wants to use services that require a user account,
the application should prompt them to create an account.<br/>
When an account has been created, the data that was associated with the device id
will be seemlessly associated with the new user account.



<a name="caching"></a>
<br/><hr/>
<h2>(4) Caching</h2>


Caching of HTTP response data enables both<br/><br/>
(1) A more responsive application<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>This creates a more pleasant user experience</i><br/><br/>
(2) Efficient utilization of server resources<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>This keeps our cost per user low enabling us to invest more in new functionality instead of hardware</i></p>

The HTTP protocol specifies 2 kinds of caching<br/>
(1) User Agent caching<br/>
(2) Proxy Server caching
<br/><br/>

We are concerned here only with user agent caching.<br/>
The protocol works as follows:<br/>
When the server sends the response to the client, it may also send along with it, a request to cache the response.<br/>
It does so by adding a couple headers to the response that the device programmer must watch for and pay attention to.<br/>
This request to cache will tell the user agent exactly how long to cache the content for.<br/>
The user agent should obey this request unless the user explicitly requests to refresh the data from server instead of using local cached data.

<br/><br/><br/>
Here is an example of what an HTTP response might look like when the server sends a request to the client to cache the response: <br/>

<pre>
Cache-Control:public, max-age=31536000
Expires: Mon, 25 Jun 2012 21:31:12 GMT
</pre>

NOTE: <b>max-age</b> tells the user agent exactly how many seconds it should cache the content for.<br/>
The <b>Expires</b> header tells the user agent what the date and time of the expiry will be.<br/><br/><br/>

The device programmer may choose to use either of these to calculate when the response data should expire.<br/>
When user selects to execute the exact same request again,<br/>
the device programmer should ensure that he checks the cache to see if unexpired data for that request still reside there,<br/>
before sending the request to the server.<br/>
The unexpired data should be offered to the user instead of sending a request
