<h1>POST songLibrary</h1>

<p>Create a library of songs for a specific device on the server.</p>


<h2>You may add songs to a new or existing library</h2>

<p>NOTE: This service may be used to either <br/>
(1) create a new song library<br/>
OR<br/>
(2) add new songs to an existing song library<br/>
</p>

<p>To add songs to an NEW library you must NOT specify a songLibraryId in the JSON you post.<br/>
Also the user must not already have a library associated with the same device. <br/>
If they do, you must either add songs to the existing library, <br/>
or DELETE the library that is already associated with the device<br/>
before trying to create a new song library for that device.</p>

<p>The songLibraryId will always be returned to you in the JSON of the HTTP response.<br/>
You will need to grab this the first time you create the library.<br/>
In the unlikely event that the library is created and you are not able to retrieve the
songLibraryId returned in the HTTP response,<br/>
you should call the <b>GET songLibraries</b> service to retrieve it.</p>

<p>To add songs to an EXISTING library you must specify the songLibraryId for the library. <br/>
And the user who is POSTing songs must be the owner of that library that they are posting to.</p>


<h2>You may use your own localSongIds or allow us to generate them for you</h2>

<p>Keeping the songs on the local device in-sync with the songs listed on the server is
essential for generating good song recommendations.<br/><br/>
The "localSongId" is the unique key used to identify each individual song in the user's
song library.<br/>
These can either be generated on the client, or you may ask the server to generate them for you.<br/>
If you generate them yourself, the JSON returned by the server will be tiny 
because no data is required by the client.<br/>
If you ask the server to generate them for you, JSON will be returned containing all of the
generated songIds and the artist and title of each song so that the client may match them
to the appropriate song.</p>

(1) the absence of the <b>id</b> property to identify the song library<br/>
(2) the existence of the <b>localSongId</b> property in each of the individual songs.<br/><br/>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data in the JSON ...</p>

<table width="100%" border="1">


<tr>
<td><span style="color:black">id</span><br/>(it's complicated)</td>
<td>
A unique identifier for the song library.<br/>
If you are adding songs to a songLibrary that already exists for the device,
the id is required <br/>
because this is how we know which library to add the songs to.<br/>
If you POST without this id, the system will try to create a new song library for you.<br/>
Only one song library is allowed per device.<br/>
So if you try to create a new library, without first deleting the old one, the POST will fail.<br/>
The rule is that a user may have 1 songLibrary per device.<br/>
In practice, most users will have only one device.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><span style="color:red">deviceId</span><br/>(required)</td>
<td>A unique identifier for the device on which the song library is stored.<br/>
Each device may only contain a single song library.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td colspan="2"><b>Song attributes</b>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><span style="color:red">song.artist</span><br/>(required)</td>
<td>
The name of the artist of the song.<br/>
Ideally this name should match the name of the artist in the graceNote database.<br/>
If it does not, certain functionality will not work well.
We may not, for example, be able to accurately determine which GraceNote genres to assign to this 
artist and song.
<br/><br/>

<span style="color:red">
BEWARE: The combination of song.artist + song.title MUST be unique in the user's library.<br/>
If you try to submit the same song twice, the POST will fail.<br/>
The records in your post BEFORE the duplicate will be inserted.<br/>
The records in your post AFTER the duplicate will not be.<br/>
If this happens, you are going to have to <b>GET songLibrary</b> to determine which 
inserts failed and which inserts succeeded<br/>
before attempting to POST again.</span>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><span style="color:red">song.title</span><br/>(required)</td>
<td>The title of the song.<br/>
Ideally this title should match the title of a song in the graceNote database.<br/>
If it does not, certain functionality will not work well.
</td>
</tr>




<tr>
<td><span style="color:black">song.tempo</span><br/>(optional)</td>
<td>
The tempo of this song, expressed as a number of beats per minute.<br/>
An integer greater than 0.<br/>
Note: Even though this is listed as an "optional" parameter, <br/>
it is highly desired that the beats per min of all songs in a users library
be known at all times. <br/>
Without this information, these songs will be excluded from 
any recommendations that require a min or max tempo.<br/>
If this information is NOT specified in the POST, the server might attempt find the tempo
information for the song elsewhere and return it to the client.<br/>
However, the server may or may not be successful in this attempt and the client should 
NOT rely upon the server succeeding.<br/><br/>

NOTE: If the user has a HUGE library, it does not make sense to force the client
to sample thousands of files to determine the tempo before POSTing the library - 
unless this can be done without negatively affecting the user experience with a delay.<br/>
An alternative approach is to POST without tempo info and wait for the server to send back
an aynchronous notification for all known tempos for the songs listed.<br/>
Upon receiving this information and updating the local database,
the client could concentrate on sampling and sending up the tempo information for
only the songs whose tempo is not already known in a PUT request.<br/>
Should the user try to retrieve recommendations based on "tempo" before the tempo is
known for all the songs, they should be notified that this feature will not work correctly
until we finish updating their database.

<p>
This POST service is different than most insofar the client will need to look at more than the return code.
</p>

<p>
Notice that the JSON returned is different than the JSON sent because it contains:<br/>
(1) a unique ID for the entire library<br/>
(2) unique ID's for each song in the library<br/>
<br/>
You will need to use these IDs to execute future operations on the individual songs
or on the library as a whole.</p>

<p>Description of the data ...</p>

<table width="100%" border="1">


<tr>
<td><span style="color:red">songLibraryId</span><br/>(guaranteed)</td>
<td>
A unique identifier for the library.<br/>
All future interactions with the library must specify this id.<br/>
Only the user who created this the song library may request operations on it.<br/>
Only a single song library is permitted per device.<br/>
You get your songLibraryId the first time that you invoke the POST songLibrary service for a particular device.<br/>
In the unlikely event that you invoke the service but lose connectivity before it returns,
you will need to invoke the <a href="GET_songLibraries.html">GET songLibraries</a> service to retrieve it.<br/>
If the device already has a songLibrary associated with it, you must either use the existing library

It is possible that the information returned for each song in the JSON is only preliminary.<br/>
The system might continue to do more work behind the scenes and update you when it has more information available 
for you.<br/>
When it does, you will receive a notification containing this jobId.<br/>
When you receive that notification, you may invoke the <a href="GET_songs.html">GET songs</a> service

You must choose one strategy or the other when you create the song library.<br/>

This "id" should be associated with each of the individual songs on the client and used whenever
any operations on the individual song is requested later. <br/>
For example, to send "tempo" information about this song to server, you would call the
