  <p>Get a list of song recommendations for a particular user.</p>

  <br />

  <h2>HTTP Request: Headers: Request Method Parameters</h2>

  <p>
    When the HTTP request method is GET or DELETE, <br /> the standard way to pass data to a service is via the
    parameters of the "request method" in the "headers" section of the HTTP request.
  </p>

  <h3>Example(s):</h3>

  <pre>
GET /sonoma/songRecommendations/id/533c91703004762e3ed2923a HTTP/1.1
Host: test.alpineconnectivity.com:8888
Authorization: Basic YWxleGFuZGVyLmoucnlhbkBnbWFpbC5jb206YmVhc3Q=
</pre>

  <pre>
GET /sonoma/songRecommendations/id/533c91703004762e3ed2923a/genre/Old+School+Hip+Hop/tempo/8.1 HTTP/1.1
Host: test.alpineconnectivity.com:8888
Authorization: Basic YWxleGFuZGVyLmoucnlhbkBnbWFpbC5jb206YmVhc3Q=
</pre>



  <p>
    NOTE: The recommendations are specific to the user and are calculated based primarily on their listening history.<br />
    The user is identified by the <b>userId</b> encoded in the
    Authorization header.
  </p>


  <p>
    This service can be used with or without parameters.<br /> The recommendation algorithm is designed to make great
    recommendations for the individual user based on their listening history without the need for any parameters to be
    sent. <br/>
    Do not send up parameters unless the user explicitly asked for the recommendations to be filtered based on
    those parameters.<br/>
    The exception to this rule is the <b>latitude</b>, <b>longitude</b> and <b>timeOfDay</b>
    parameters. These should always be sent.<br /> <br /> 
    
    If you choose to pass parameters, you may mix and match as
    you'd like with a few exceptions: <br />
  <ul>
    <li>Don't specify both a <b>genre</b> and an <b>artist</b>. If you specify both, the <b>genre</b> will be
      ignored.
    </li>
    <li><b>latitude</b> and <b>longitude</b> must be specified together. Don't send one without the other.</li>
  </ul>


  </p>

  <table width="100%" border="1">

    <tr>
      <td><br />genre<br />(optional)</td>
      <td>Restrict song recommendations to those of a particular genre.<br /> <br /> 
      Example:<br/>
      <b>GET
          /songRecommendations/genre/Old+School+Hip+Hop</b><br /> <br /> <b>NOTE</b>: It is very important the name of the
        genre you pass into this parameter must <b>EXACTLY MATCH</b> the name of one of the genres in the Gracenote
        database.<br /> The complete list of genres currently available is available via the <a
        href="GET_subGenres.html">GET subGenres</a> service. <br /> It is highly recommended that you provided some
        sort of a mapping service to map an existing genre name to one of the official Gracenote genres <b>BEFORE</b>
        invoking this service. <br /> At some stage in the future, this service *might* implement a matching algorithm
        itself. However, it does not currently do so.<br /> If the name of the genre does not exactly match one of the
        GraceNote genres the service will not return any recommendations.<br /> <br /> <b>NOTE</b>: If you pass either
        a valid <b>top level genre</b> or a valid <b>sub genre</b> to this service, you will get song recommendations
        back.<br /> However, song recommendations are currently only offered for the top level genres that the sub
        genres tree up to. <br /> So sub genres are converted to top level genre before the results are returned.<br />
        <br /> <b>Example</b> "Black Metal" is a sub genre of the top level genre "Metal"<br /> See the <a
        href="GET_subGenres.html">GET subGenres</a> service to retrieve a complete list of all valid sub genres and the
        top level genres they map to.<br /> <br /> <b>NOTE</b>: It is very important that this parameter be URL
        encoded before being sent up to the server. <br /> Many of the genre names contain not only spaces but also
        forward slashes.<br /> <br /> <b>Example:</b> "Hip Hop/Rap" urlencoded becomes "Hip+Hop%2FRap"<br /> <br />

      Example:<br/>
      <b>GET
          /songRecommendations/tempo/5.2</b><br /> <br /> Every song has a <b>tempo</b> specified in <b>beats per
          minute</b><br />. On the server side, we convert the tempo of each song from beats per minute to a number between
        0 and 10.<br /> 0 is the lowest tempo.</br/> 5 is medium tempo.<br /> 10 is the fastest tempo.<br /> It is
        envisioned that a user will request a higher or lower tempo song by moving a slider up or down.<br/><br/>
        
          <b>NOTE:</b> The server does not know the tempo of any of the songs.<br/>
          We will be relying on the client apps to record and report this information to the server.<br/>
          There will be many songs on the server database that have a tempo of UNKNOWN until the devices 
          that have the songs on them have reported the tempo to the server.<br/>
          A mechanism must be developed for the server to notify the device of the BPM count it needs and for the 
          device to send this information to the server. If the tempo measuring software is accurate, we will
          only need the tempo of the song to be recorded a single time
          by a single client device.

          Initially, ONLY local recommendations will be available because we are not integrating with a streaming service at this time.<br/><br/>
          
          <b>NOTE:</b> The user's music library must be know to the server before recommendations against it can be made.<br/>
          Logging the contents of the library and additions and deletions to it via the logging service will not be sufficient.<br/>
          Real-time services must be provided in order to give the user the responsiveness they desire.<br/>
          After they load songs into the app, we can't tell them to come back tomorrow after the batch job has been run before
          recommendations will be available to them.<br/>
